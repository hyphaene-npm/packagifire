this package is meant to manipulate the package.json to install all the keys and scripts used in several projects.

The idea would be to have a multi selection on all the clis I've made, and to install this clis in addition of the manipulation of the package.json file itself ( since installing a package is modifying it, seems to feet to the first idea)

so basically :

what do you want to set :
- redux-friends ( install )
- react-friends ( install )
- reduxifire ( install && add script)
- versionifier ( install && scripts && key )

v2 : install all selected global CLIs
- reactifire
- utilifire
- clonifire
